      <h3><span>Need help</span> for GST registration in multiple states of India?</h3>
      <hr class="divider">

      <p>It is only when you have operations in a particular state, which is a place of business or office that you have to register in that state. For example, you are a Gurgaon based service provider who seldom provides services in Delhi. Then you don't need to obtain registration in Delhi.</p>
      <p>However, if you have an office in Delhi apart from Gurgaon, then it becomes mandatory for you to obtain registration in Delhi as well as Gurgaon.</p>

        Disclaimer: We do not directly provide any GST registration certificates or offer any government services. We are an aggregator of virtual office addresses, which enables our customers to independently apply for GST registration at <a href="https://www.gst.gov.in/">https://www.gst.gov.in/</a> at the discretion of the Government of India. Our services merely facilitate the application process by providing a virtual office address.
